In my very last article, I shared some JavaScript tips and tricks. In this article, I will be covering HTML tips and tricks ‚ú®.

## The `start` Attribute

The `start` attribute allows you to specify a starting number for your list items.

```html
<ol start="20">
    <li>Pineapple üçç</li>
    <li>Apple üçé</li>
    <li>Greenapple üçè</li>
</ol>
```

3 items of fruits starting from 20. The number `20` is specified using the `start` attribute.

## The `contenteditable` Attribute

Set the `contenteditable` attribute to `true`, and your content will be editable.

<p contenteditable="true">It can be something about you.</p>
```

## The `required` Attribute

Set the `required` attribute on input fields that are mandatory to be filled.

## The `<mark>` Tag

Use the `<mark>` tag instead of styling spans to highlight text.

```html
<p>This is <mark>important</mark></p>
```

Highlighted text achieved with the `<mark>` tag.

---

## The `lazy` Loading Attribute

Add the `loading="lazy"` attribute on media elements to enhance page performance by deferring the loading of media elements until the user scrolls to them.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Alternative text">
```

## The `<kbd>` Tag

Use the `<kbd>` tag when presenting keyboard inputs.

```

## The `<details>` & `<summary>` Tags

You can craft nice-looking accordions using the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements. These have built-in keyboard accessibility features.

```html
<details>
    <summary>Can I save and love ‚ù§Ô∏è this article?</summary>
    <p>Follow on Twitter for more stuff.</p>
    <p>Save for updates.</p>
</details>
```

## The `accept` Attribute

The `accept` attribute allows you to specify which types of files the user can upload.

## The Favicon

Set `link rel="icon"` to define a favicon.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="logo.webp">
```

---

## The `<picture>` Tag

The `<picture>` tag allows you to present images of different aspect ratios based on screen sizes. It is awesome for implementing responsive web design.

```html
<picture>
    <source srcset="large.webp" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
    <source srcset="medium.webp" media="(min-width: 800px)">
    <img src="regular.jpg" />
</picture>
```

## The `dir` Attribute

You can set your text direction from right-to-left or left-to-right using the `dir` attribute. Set `dir="auto"` to automatically change text direction based on language.

<p dir="rtl">Awesome!</p>
```

## The `spellcheck` Attribute

Use the `spellcheck` attribute to check for spelling errors.

```html
<input type="email" spellcheck="true">

## The Meta Description

Add meta descriptions in the `<head>` of your HTML to have an indirect impact on search engine optimization. The meta description represents the text that appears beneath the site name on the search engine result page.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Gitpod streamlines developer workflows by providing prebuilt, collaborative developer environments in your browser - powered by VS Code.">
```

</select>
```

```html
<video src="video.mp4" poster="flowers.jpg"></video>

    <li>Apple üçé</li>
    <li>Greenapple üçè</li>
</ol>
```

List numbers starting in reversed order, from 3 to 1 instead of 1 to 3.
